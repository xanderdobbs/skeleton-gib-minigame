![Skeleton](assets/skeleton.gif)

A simple demo implementation of destructable enemy bodies (aka 'gibs').

I wanted to see if the naive, brute-force approach of just spawning sprites would work. And it does! I can destroy hundreds and hundreds of skeletons on my lower-end PC without Godot breaking a sweat.
